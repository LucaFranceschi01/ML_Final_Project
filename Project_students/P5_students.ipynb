In the financial sector (but also in general in any company) fraud detection and customer credit score are key in order to determine the risk before granting a loan. Complementary, Bank companies uses to qualify the asset (e.g. a house, a vehicle, etc...) that the customer pretends to buy in order to evaluate the risk that the credit cannot be payed back. \n","\n","Therefore, as a Customer Intelligence team member, you will be responsible for designing, developing and analyzing the **intelligence** to lead the business of our Bank company.\n","\n","\n","In particular:\n","\n","- You will apply unsupervised learning to cluster a customer base in order to \"understand\" the main patters and characteritics of the **groups** or **segments**. Customer segmentation is a very useful tool and crucial in any **data-driven** company. \n","\n","- You will also apply supervised learning to develop a model able to classify customers between high and low risk of default in case of receiving a credit or loan. \n","\n","- You will develop a regression model in order to determine an objective price for second hand vehicles, due to they are one of main reasons because our customers request a credit\n","\n","- As a bonus track we will complement the previous model as a classification stage that split between trucks (usually for professional customers) and cars (usually for particular customers) based on images.\n","\n","\n","To solve all these questions we will follow a common framework or way-of-working in Machine Learning projects: the **Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) life-cycle**.

A wrong definition will imply a failure in any of the next stages. To address this part of the workflow there are different several tools and ML canvas that facilitates the high-level description and main aspects of the system.

Data understanding will facilitate the identification of the most relevant data to our purpose.\n","- (c) **Data cleaning and preparation**: removing outliers, null management, categorical variables encoding,... are examples of main activities included in this sub-stage.\n","\n","(3) **Modelling or ML Model Engineering**: it includes model training, evaluation, testing and insights generation. As an output of this stage of the workflow, the ML model is packaged as a final step before been deployed in our ML infrastructure.\n","- (a) Model training implies the selection of the technique or combination of techniques that suits better for the use case. Feature engineering is also included.\n","- (b) Model evaluation and test: allows to determine the perfomance of the trained model and decide if it is good enough to our use case.\n","- (c) insight generation: Once the model is trained and validated its performance, in this sub-stage we go back to our initial stage (i.e. business problem) to ensure that it meets the business objectives defined as use case. \n","- (d) Model packing: Once the built ML has been validated and tested, the model is ready to be exported to the infrastructure responsible for executing, monitoring and maintenance.\n","\n","(4) **Code engineering**: in this final stage of the MLOps workflow the model is deployed into production where performance monitoring and logging is done. The subtasks are:\n","- (a) Model serving: it refers to how the model is integration of the final application or software. This integration could be done via API, on-demand serving, pre-calculated, etc.... The deployment of the model could be via a docker container in cloud or local or as a serveless function.\n","- (b) Model monitoring and logging: it refers to the periodic observation of the ML performance and comparision with original trained one.
